# Security Hardening Mechanism
<h3>Introduction to Security Hardening</h3>
Security Hardening
Security hardening is a critical aspect of maintaining the overall security posture of an organization. This involves implementing various mechanisms and best practices to enhance the security of IT systems, networks, and databases. Two essential elements of security hardening are the use of automatic back-ups and firewalls.

Automatic back-ups provide a critical safety net in the event of a security incident. By regularly backing up systems and servers, organizations can ensure that they can quickly recover from a security breach or other disruptions, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of data loss.

Firewalls, on the other hand, serve as a first line of defense against external threats. By controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic, firewalls help limit the total attack surface of a system and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. Firewalls can also help prevent the spread of malware and other malicious software, protecting against a wide range of cyber threats.

This project has provided valuable insights into the benefits of firewalls and automatic back-ups as essential elements of security hardening. Through the implementation and configuration of firewalls, we have seen how these mechanisms can help limit the total attack surface, prevent unauthorized access, and protect sensitive data. Additionally, we have explored the importance of automatic back-ups in providing a safety net in the event of a security incident, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of data loss.

Overall, this project has reinforced the critical role that security hardening plays in maintaining the overall security posture of an organization. By implementing automatic back-ups and firewalls, organizations can better protect against a wide range of cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and data.

This project aims to enhance my understanding of security hardening and mechanisms to strengthen the overall security of an organization. This includes:

•	Firewall configuration: Limiting the total attack surface by configuring firewalls to only allow necessary connections.

•	Automatic back-up: Ensuring that systems and servers are backed up regularly to provide a backup plan in case of a security incident.

•	Automatic patch update: Keeping the operating system and applications up to date to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.


Other security hardening measures include:

•	Disabling unused ports or applications: Limiting the attack surface by disabling ports or applications that the organization does not use.

•	Regular security audits: Conducting regular audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

•	Employee training: Providing training to employees on security best practices and potential threats.

•	Incident response plan: Developing a plan to respond to security incidents, including communication with stakeholders and recovery strategies.

In this project, we would be focusing on Firewall configuration and Automatic back-up as a security hardening mechanism. By implementing these measures, we can enhance our organization's security posture and minimize the risk of security incidents, by reducing the overall attack surface and deter malicious attackers.
